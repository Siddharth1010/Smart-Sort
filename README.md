# Smart-Sort 

## Objective
Waste Classification helps in its effective and efficient disposal. However, separating them manually is a tedious process and also not efficient. Improper segregation results in pollution and affects the environment. We intend to develop an automated bin that automatically classifies and segregates wastes as Bio-Degradable and Non-Biodegradable and places them in the respective bin. We plan to achieve the same using IoT by passing the image data to the Cloud to perform analytics and return the classified output to the controller of the bin and triggers it to place the waste in correct container. We also send the usage data to the cloud to perform analytics about the bin usage and deploy it in a web app to report the live status. The users will also be awarded some credit points based on the amount of biodegradable waste they throw-in. They can use these credit points as vouchers on Amazon/eBay etc.

## Climate Impact

The inefficient segregation of waste is a major cause of environmental pollution. As we all know, pollution is a major factor contributing to the deterioration of the world’s climate scenario. In India, the Swachh Bharat Mission was created by the government to promote proper waste disposal to maintain clean cities and thereby protect the environment. Unfortunately, it is not being followed by a major portion of citizens. It is inhumane to expect the government to manually segregate biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste from landfills. So, biodegradable waste is not used for energy generation and further contributes to pollution. Although inculcating responsibility among citizens is the top priority, it is a time-consuming goal. So, we have created a system that automates the entire waste segregation process thereby eliminating the need for ‘dirty work’. Through this system, the waste classified can be used for a variety of purposes - Biodegradable waste can be used to generate sustainable energy and NonBiodegradable waste can be recycled. As an effect, pollution is reduced. If implemented widely, this could majorly affect climate change for the better.
